# PhysicsForYou

PhysicsForYou is a Java library designed to offer a wide range of physics formulas through simple method calls. It facilitates the implementation of physics calculations in academic, educational, and software development projects. Whether you're building a physics simulation, solving academic problems, or just exploring the wonders of physical laws, PhysicsForYou provides an easy-to-use API to access a variety of physics formulas.

## Features

- **Wide Range of Formulas**: Offers accessible formulas from mechanics, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics.
- **Easy-to-Use Library**: Designed with simplicity in mind, allowing you to effortlessly integrate physics calculations into your projects.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each class and method is documented, making it easy to understand how to use the library.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into three main components:
  - `FluidDynamics.java` for fluid mechanics calculations.
  - `Mechanics.java` for general mechanics problems.
  - `Thermodynamics.java` for thermodynamic properties and calculations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

PhysicsForYou requires Java 8 or higher. Ensure Java is installed on your system before integrating the library.

### Installation

To use PhysicsForYou, clone the repository or download the latest release from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/PhysicsForYou.git
```

Then, include the library in your Java project's build path.

### Quick Start

Here's how you can use PhysicsForYou in your project. For example, to calculate the force due to gravity between two masses:

```java
import com.physicsforyou.Mechanics;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double mass = 5.972e24; 
        double velocity = 700000; 

        double kineticEnergy  = Mechanics.calculateKineticEnergy(mass, velocity);
        System.out.println("The kinetic energy of this object is: " + kineticEnergy + " Joules");
    }
}
```
